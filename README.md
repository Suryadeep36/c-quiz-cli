## Intro
Heyy!! I Made a command line interface using javascript and npm packages.
It consists of the following npm packages:-
- chalk and chalk-animation
- figlet
- gradient-string
- inquirer

I used chalk to colour and style normal text. Then, I gave it some animation using chalk-animation. Also, to display bigger text messages I utilized figlet, and to give those messages some gradient colour I used gradient-string.
To create a prompt-based interface I used inquirer which asks questions with 4 options and validates the answer.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher (recommended:- 18.16.1)
- Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system
